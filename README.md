# MapExample
Someone on reddit asked for a openstreetmap &amp; leaflet.js example so here it is.

Lets you draw on the map and puts up an alert() containing the latlng details.

The HTML file can be run in a browser without a server but you would need some
server later to handle the storing & fetching of the inputted records.

Requires an internet connection because it uses CDN's for the JS packages.
